.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
(Toad Opens All Devices)
is a utility meant to be started from the
.Xr hotplugd 8
.Em attach
and
.Em detach
scripts.
It will try to mount all partitions found on the device under
.Pa /run/media/${USER}/device .
Where ${USER} is the active user
.Em login
name and
.Em device
is the type of the device,
.Em usb
or
.Em cd ,
followed by its number (from
.Em 0
to
.Em 9 ) .
This follows the
.Em udev
hierarchy in Linux which allows interaction with GLib/GIO's GUnixMount.
.Pp
Users outside the default UID range (1000...60000) are ignored (nothing will
be done).
.Pp
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar action
Can be
.Ar attach
(for device attachment)
or
.Ar detach
(for device detachment).
.It Ar devclass
Integer corresponding to the device class as described in the
.Aq Pa sys/device.h
header file,  e.g.\&
.Pa 2
for disk drives.
.It Ar devname
Device name as listed in
.Xr MAKEDEV 8 ,
and the unit number, e.g.\&
.Pa sd1 .
.El
.Pp
Detection of the currently active user is done using ConsoleKit and DBus,
.Nm
will not do anything unless these are properly setup and running.
Obviously,
.Xr hotplugd 8
must be running as well.
.Xr rcctl 8
can be used to enable and start
.Xr hotplugd 8
and
.Xr dbus-daemon 1 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.Ev rcctl enable hotplugd messagebus
.Ev rcctl start hotplugd messagebus
.Ed
.Sh EXAMPLES
This sample code can be used for both the
.Em attach
and
.Em detach
scripts:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#!/bin/sh

DEVCLASS=$1
DEVNAME=$2

case $DEVCLASS in
2)
	/usr/local/libexec/toad ${0##*/} $DEVCLASS $DEVNAME
